# Climate Change Topic - Rising Temperatures, Rising Seas: The Urgent Need for Climate Action

This data journalism piece employs the scrollytelling technique to showcase annual global temperature and sea level changes resulting from climate change. The data-driven story was created by Zhaozhou Dai. It incorporates a combination of data visualization and written content, drawing insights from interviews with a range of climate journalists and other industry professionals from reputable media outlets such as ProPublica, Grist and The Boston Globe.

The story was developed in partnership with Northeastern University's Co-Laboratory for Data Impact, an association specializing in citizen-oriented, impactful visual storytelling. The data-driven piece leverages diverse approaches, including journalistic, design-centered, and artistic elements, to broaden the understanding of public climate change data storytelling.
